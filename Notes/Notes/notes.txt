My Nmap study notes
## What is Nmap?
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a free and open-source tool used for:
- Host discovery
- Port scanning
- Service and version detection
- OS fingerprinting
- Vulnerability detection (using NSE scripts)

## Basic Scan Types

### 1. Ping Scan
Command:
    nmap -sn <target-ip>
Purpose:
    Check if a host is online.

### 2. Basic Port Scan
Command:
    nmap <target-ip>
Purpose:
    Scans the 1000 most common ports.

### 3. Service/Version Detection
Command:
    nmap -sV <target-ip>
Purpose:
    Shows which services are running and their versions.

### 4. OS Detection
Command:
    nmap -O <target-ip>
Purpose:
    Attempts to identify the operating system.

### 5. Aggressive Scan
Command:
    nmap -A <target-ip>
Purpose:
    Combines OS detection, version detection, script scanning.

## Useful Flags
- `-p` → specify port(s)
- `-Pn` → skip host discovery
- `-sS` → stealth SYN scan
- `-sU` → UDP scan
- `-T4` → faster scan timing

## My Lab Setup
- Host Machine: Windows
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: Ubuntu
- Network: NAT + Host-Only Adapter

## Key Learnings
- How to identify live hosts
- How to analyze open/closed ports
- How network adapters impact connectivity
- How to prepare scan reports for GitHub
